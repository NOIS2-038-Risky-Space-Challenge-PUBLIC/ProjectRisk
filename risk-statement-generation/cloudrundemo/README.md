This contains all files necessary to build a docker container of the flask webapp to deploy to serverless cloud services.

A working demo of this web app has been deployed at [https://riskgenrrun-sutjj3wk2q-uc.a.run.app/](https://riskgenrrun-sutjj3wk2q-uc.a.run.app/)

#Upload a small txt file only (truncate to 2,000 words or less, ~4 pages)
#Demo infers on CPU (instead of GPU), can take some time to run
#Only trained the T5 sequence to sequence model on ~10 examples so there can occassionally be results that are not useful. But this also means thereâ€™s lots of potential to improve the results (generate more training examples, add more/varied gates to the pipeline to prune out nonsense).
