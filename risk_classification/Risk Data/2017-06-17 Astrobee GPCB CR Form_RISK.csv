Title of change: Astrobee FY17/18 Milestone Changes 4.,0,,,
PROJECT/Task name(S) (if applicable): HET2 Astrobee 5.,0,,,
"Description (briefly describe the change being requested): Due to development delays and new estimated dates for FY18 activities (launch, deployment, commissioning), it is necessary to revised the project’s remaining controlled milestones for Astrobee: (1) Replace “FY17 #1 Cert Unit testing complete” (8/30/2017) and “FY17 #2 Flight Units testing complete” (9/30/2017) with “FY18 #1 Cert/Flight Units testing complete” (11/30/2017); (2) Rename Astrobee “FY18 #1 Astrobee first flight/basic mobility complete” (4/30/2018) to “FY18 #2 Astrobee first flight/basic mobility complete” (date is unchanged); (3) Rename Astrobee “FY18 #2 Astrobee operations demonstration”” (9/15/2018) to ““FY18 #3 Astrobee operations demonstration” (date is unchanged).",0,,,
Justification (why is the change needed): Discussions at the Periodic Technical Review (PTR) 3 Delta identified issues in the avionics design.,0,,,
"To address these issues, the project was required to develop and test an additional Astrobee prototype unit (“P4E”).",0,,,
"Although the P4E unit significantly reduced risks associated with the avionics subsystem, this activity significantly delayed finalization of design drawings and the start of procurement for certification and flight unit production.",0,,,
"Consequently, the project has replanned production to build both certification and flight units concurrently rather than as two separate (and largely sequential) tasks.",0,,,
This approach should save some production time by removing duplicative set up time for assembly.,0,,,
"Additionally, acceptance and performance testing can be parallelized by performing ARC testing on the cert unit, while simultaneously sending a flight unit to JSC for network (Joint Station LAN), electromagnetic interference (EMI), and acoustic testing.",0,,,
"Need DATE & RATIONALE (approved by date and why this date): 8/30/2017, this is the current due date for FY17 #1.",0,,,

SCOPE AND AFFECTED PRODUCTS (Describe project scope changes including products or deliverables impacted) or mark n/a if none: N/A 11.,0,,,
"Schedule Impact: The proposed schedule change will not effect the commissioning milestone dates, but does removes some FY18 schedule reserve.",0,,,
The remaining schedule reserve is primarily concentrated between the current on-dock dates for Astrobee’s target ISS upmass flights (Space X-14 and Orbital ATK-9).,0,,,
DESCRIBE THE RISK TO THE PROJECT/PROGRAM IF THIS CHANGE DOES NOT OCCUR: Astrobee project execution will continue to show a three month lag through the first quarter of FY18.,1,Schedule,,
