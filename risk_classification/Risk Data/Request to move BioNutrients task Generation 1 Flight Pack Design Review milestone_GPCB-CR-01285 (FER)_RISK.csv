"TYPE OF CHANGE: Minor: No change to system function or performance, minimal impact to technical, cost, and/or schedule 2.",0,,,
SENSITIVITY: Non-sensitive 3.,0,,,
Title of change: Request to move BioNutrients task Generation 1 Flight Pack Design Review milestone 4.,0,,,
PROJECT/Task name(S) (if applicable): Syn Bio: Synthetic Biology 5.,0,,,
"Description (briefly describe the change being requested): The BioNutrients task Generation 1 Flight Pack Design Review was scheduled for Jan 19, 2021.",0,,,
We request additional time to conduct testing and perform analysis needed for the review.,0,,,
Additional time was added to allow for the scheduling of a concurrent TAPR during this review.,0,,,
"Justification (why is the change needed): Laboratory access was not available from March 9, 2020 to December 2021 due to Sars-2 Covid 19 access restrictions.",1,Schedule,,
"Required biocompatibility and engineering testing of the bioreactor designs could not take place, and we are experiencing delays in receipt of test materials and commercial test organisms due to Covid 19 impacts on our suppliers and NASA p-card purchasing limitations.",1,Schedule,,
Together this has impacted progress.,1,Schedule,,
Additional time will allow us to meet this milestone.,0,,,
Need DATE & RATIONALE (approved by date and why this date): 3/15/2021 We are not requesting additional funding or an extension of the overall project schedule at this time.,0,,,
We are actively working to determine a new date.,0,,,
"We do not expect to hold the review any earlier than March 15, 2021.",0,,,
"With the inclusion of the TAPR, we are asking to set the new date to 7/15/21, with a working date of 6/15/21, and add the word ""TAPR"" to the tile of the controlled milestone.",0,,,

SCOPE AND AFFECTED PRODUCTS (Describe project scope changes including products or deliverables impacted)or mark n/a if none: [ScopeChangeDescription] 10.,0,,,
Schedule Impact: No change to overall 5 year project task schedule.,0,,,
"Increases likelihood that BioNutrients-2 experiment may not meet target launch on SPX-24, currently estimated as occurring in December 2021.",1,Schedule,,
"We are currently only targeting that opportunity, and have not been manifested yet.",0,,,
Impacts to manifest will be dependent on many factors.,0,,,
DESCRIBE THE RISK TO THE PROJECT/PROGRAM IF THIS CHANGE DOES NOT OCCUR: No risk to the technology 12.,0,,,
Additional comments: Delays in the gen-1 bioreactor development will limit the time available to incorporate new data to impact the gen-2 bioreactor development planned for the final year of the project as part of the BioNutrients-3 experiment.,1,Schedule,,
"However, as data and impacts of the gen-1 bioreactor will only be revealed post gen -1 ISS flight test, any impacts to design schedule for the gen-2 bioreactor cannot be predicted at this time.",1,Schedule,,
