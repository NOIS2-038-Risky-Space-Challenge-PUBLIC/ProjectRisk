"Context Microgravity causes an absence of convective forces which in turn can limit gas exchange, mixing and consequently limit resources and negatively impact microbial growth.",0,,,
Conditions on orbit may also limit degree of full mixing and dissolving of the microbial pellet during hydration due to impacts on wetting actions under microgravity.,0,,,
"As the crew is manually shaking the bioreactor to create mixing, and checks to see if mixing and dissolving has occurred, this is relatively unlikely but not predictable from ground testing.",0,,,
These two factors together represent a risk unique to the microgravity environment that can only be assessed via on orbit testing.,0,,,
Status 03/2021.,0,,,
We have conducted 3 runs on the ISS and are awaiting sample analysis to determine if there has been any unexpected and unfavorable impacts to the expected microbial growth.,0,,,

We have samples returned from the ISS from our first two production pack runs but have been unable to perform the analysis due to Covid-19 facilities restrictions.,0,,,
We also need access to support upcoming on orbit operations and ground control operations for the next production pack run.,0,,,
"We can delay the next run but this creates a greater period within our planned sampling schedule, and we may miss data that impacts our understanding of how the system is impacted over time.",0,,,
