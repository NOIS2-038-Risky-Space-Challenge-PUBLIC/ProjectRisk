"WBS Structure 39 Objectives Introduction The purpose of the Human Exploration Telerobotics 2 (HET2) project is to mature telerobotics technology to increase the performance, reduce the cost, and improve the success of human space exploration.",0,,,
"To do this, HET2 will develop a new free-flying robot, Astrobee, and mature Robonaut 2, to: (1) off-load routine and repetitive work from astronauts, and (2) extend and enhance crew capabilities.",0,,,
HET2 will test these robots in laboratories on the ground and on the International Space Station (ISS).,0,,,
HET2 is a research and technology project within the Game Changing Development Program (GCD) in NASA's Space Technology Mission Directorate (STMD).,0,,,
"Future human space missions in Earth orbit, to the Moon, and to distant destinations offer many new opportunities for exploration.",0,,,
"However, astronaut time will always be in short supply, consumables (e.g., oxygen) will always be limited, and some work will not be feasible, or productive, for astronauts to do manually.",0,,,
"Remotely operated robots, however, can complement astronauts by performing this work under remote supervision by humans from a space station, spacecraft, habitat, or even from Earth.",0,,,
"Telerobots, particularly semi-autonomous systems, can increase the performance and productivity of human space exploration.",0,,,
"Telerobots are well suited to performing tasks that are tedious, highly repetitive, dangerous or long-duration, such as routine in-flight maintenance, systematic surveys, etc.",0,,,
Telerobots can also provide side-by-side assistance to astronauts during both intravehicular (IVA) and extravehicular activities (EVA).,0,,,
"Telerobots can also perform ""follow-up"" work to complete or supplement tasks started by humans.",0,,,
"Today, astronauts on the ISS not only conduct science activities, but they also perform a variety of tasks required for ISS housekeeping and in-flight system maintenance.",0,,,
The remote monitoring and operation of many ISS systems by ground control has become an accepted practice for certain ISS tasks during the past decade.,0,,,
"In terms of telerobotics, however, these tasks are limited to coarse positioning maneuvers of external payloads/structures using manipulator arms, such as the Space Station Remote Manipulator System (SSRMS).",0,,,
"However, other types of robots, particularly free-flyers and dexterous humanoids, offer significant potential to perform a greater variety of tasks.",0,,,
"These tasks include routine, repetitive or simple but long-duration work, such as conducting environment surveys, taking sensor readings or performing routine maintenance.",0,,,
"Thus, the central focus of HET2 is to develop, test, and demonstrate how advanced telerobots, which can be operated by ground controllers on Earth and by astronauts in space, can effectively and efficiently carry out these tasks.",0,,,
Technical Objectives HET2 is composed of two elements: Astrobee and Robonaut 2.,0,,,
Astrobee The Astrobee Element (FY15 to FY18) will focus on developing a new free-flying robot suitable for performing IVA work on the ISS.,0,,,
"The new robot will build upon technology and lessons learned from the Smart Synchronized Position Hold, Engage, Reorient, Experimental Satellite (SPHERES) robot, which was developed and tested by the Human Exploration Telerobotics (HET) project under the Technology Demonstration Missions (TDM) program.",0,,,
"Astrobee will be designed to address a variety of scenarios, which will be developed and detailed in collaboration with the Advanced Exploration Systems (AES) program and the ISS SPHERES Facility in the Human Exploration and Operations Mission Directorate (HEOMD).",0,,,
"Candidate scenarios include mobile sensor (including imagers), automated logistics (e.g., mobile inventory), and free-flying robotic testbed.",0,,,
"Success for Astrobee involves developing and testing robot technologies required for autonomous operations (including free-flying mobility), remote operation by ground controllers, and human-robot interaction with crew.",0,,,
"These technologies include propulsion, robot user interface (proximal and remote), supervisory control, payload interface, and/or navigation.",0,,,
Successful on-orbit testing and demonstration of these technologies following the ISS payload process will bring the system to TRL 8.,0,,,
Table 1 specifies which capabilities must be demonstrated for minimum and full success.,0,,,
Robonaut 2 The Robonaut 2 Element (FY15 to FY16-Q1) will focus on advancing the capabilities of the Robonaut series of humanoid robots to perform both IVA and EVA on the ISS.,0,,,
"The continued advancement of Robonaut 2, which was developed and tested by HET and other NASA projects, will build upon technology and lessons learned to date from Robonaut 2.",0,,,
"Minimum success for the Robonaut 2 Element involves developing and testing relevant robotic technologies, including legged mobility with climbing limbs, autonomous task software, and/or computer vision to TRL 5.",0,,,
Success Criteria Table 1 summarizes the minimum and full success criteria for HET2.,0,,,
"HET2 Success Criteria Element Minimum Success Full Success Astrobee ISS demonstration of: · Ground control · JEM/Node 2/US Lab map · Software upgrade · Hazard detection · Dock/undock · Streamed video · Payload & Guest Science (GS) operations · GS data distribution ISS demonstration of: · Crew control · USOS map · Signal lights · Perch/unperch · Multi-robot ops · Mobile camera ops Robonaut 2 Develop at least one of the following humanoid robot technologies to TRL 5: legged mobility, autonomous task software, and/or computer vision.",0,,,
Transition to Human Robotic Systems (HRS) project after minimal success criteria have been met.,0,,,
"Impact HET2 will benefit NASA by: (1) reducing the risks and cost in human spaceflight; (2) increasing human exploration and operation mission performance, and (3) providing remotely operated robots to improve astronaut efficiency (off-load routine and repetitive tasks) and capabilities (extend human reach and sphere of influence).",0,,,
"As humans prepare to venture deeper into space, consideration is being given to developing a cis-lunar ""waypoint facility"", perhaps at the Earth-Moon ""L2 Lagrange Point"", which would serve as a gateway to multiple destinations including the Moon, Near-Earth Asteroids (NEA), and Mars.",0,,,
"This facility would enable assembly and servicing of satellites, telescopes, and deep-space exploration vehicles.",0,,,
"This facility could also be used as a platform for astrophysics, heliophysics, and distant Earth observation.",0,,,
"This facility would also serve as a pre-cursor for a similar facility near Mars, perhaps in orbit or deployed on the surface of Phobos.",0,,,
"In contrast to the ISS, which is continuously manned, a waypoint facility will be intermittently occupied.",0,,,
"Consequently, there is a significant need to robotically care-take the facility, in order to maintain and repair systems in the absence of human crew.",0,,,
"These robots will perform both IVA and EVA work, remotely operated and supervised from Earth.",0,,,
"Telerobotic caretaking would focus on inspection, monitoring, routine maintenance, and contingency handling of the facility (and possibly attached structures, vehicles, etc.).",0,,,
"In particular, experience with the ISS has shown that power (generation, switching, storage), life support (air, water, thermal), data networking, and instruments all need to be maintained.",0,,,
"To do this, remotely operated robots, such as Astrobee and Robonaut 2, will need to be developed, tested, and placed into operational use on the ISS to understand the associated costs, benefits, limitations, and risks.",0,,,
Relevance HET2 is well aligned to the 2013 NASA Strategic Space Technology Investment Plan (SSTIP) in several ways.,0,,,
"First, the SSTIP identifies ""Robotics and Autonomous Systems"" as a core technology area that is indispensable for NASA's present and planned future missions.",0,,,
"Second, the SSTIP recommends that research and development address autonomous robotics and more on-board autonomy.",0,,,
"Finally, the SSTIP specifically identifies free-flying and humanoid robots to assist crew in performing routine or hazardous tasks as examples of strategic investment.",0,,,
One of the ways that HET2 will test technologies is on the ISS.,0,,,
"These technologies will benefit both current ISS missions and future missions, particularly deep-space human exploration.",0,,,
"As such, HET2 is also well aligned with NASA's Strategic Goal 1.1: ""Sustain the operation and full use of the ISS and expand efforts to utilize the ISS as a National Laboratory for scientific, technological, diplomatic, and educational purposes and for supporting future objectives in human space exploration.""",0,,,
"HET2 is broadly relevant to the 2015 ""Robotics and Autonomous Systems"" (TA 4) NASA Technology Roadmap.",0,,,
Table 2 describes how HET2 work will advance technology in all seven major TA 4 roadmap areas.,0,,,
"Finally, HET2 addresses the NASA Strategic Plan 2014 (NPD 1001.0B) as follows: Strategic Goal 1: Expand the frontiers of knowledge, capability, and opportunity in space HET2 will increase knowledge and understanding of how to design and operate remotely operated space robots in conjunction with human spaceflight HET2 will increase the capabilities of robots to perform IVA/EVA work in space HET2 will increase the efficiency of human explorers by allowing routine, repetitive work to be off-loaded to robots HET2 will enhance the capabilities of human explorers by enabling robots to be remotely operated by crew Table 2.",0,,,
"HET2 relevance to the 2015 Robotics and Autonomous Systems (TA 4) technology roadmap Technical Area HET2 Relevance TA4.1 Sensing and Perception Both Astrobee and Robonaut 2 will advance technology in 3D sensing (TA4.1.1), state estimation (TA4.1.2), onboard mapping (TA4.1.3), object, event, and activity recognition (TA4.1.4), and force and tactile sensing (TA4.1.5).",0,,,

"TA4.5 System-Level Autonomy Both Astrobee and Robonaut 2 will advance technology in activity planning, sequencing, and execution (TA4.5.2).",0,,,
"TA4.6 Autonomous Rendezvous & Docking Both Astrobee and Robonaut 2 will advance technology in relative navigation sensors (TA4.6.1), guidance, navigation and control algorithms (TA4.6.2), and docking & capture mechanisms (TA4.6.3).",0,,,
"TA4.7 Systems Engineering Both Astrobee and Robonaut 2 will advance technology in modularity, commonality, and interfaces (TA4.7.1), robot modeling and simulation (TA4.7.3), and robot software (TA4.7.4).",0,,,
"Objective 1.1: Expand human presence into the solar system and to the surface of Mars to advance exploration, science, innovation, benefits to humanity, and international collaboration.",0,,,
"HET2 will develop two new classes of space robots (IVA free-flyer and dexterous humanoid) that can be used to tend, or caretake, human spacecraft / habitats that may be intermittently manned HET2 will advance exploration by enabling robotically tended ""waypoint"" facilities to be considered for deep-space exploration HET2 will produce numerous innovations in perception, control, and human-robot interaction for space robots Objective 1.7: Transform NASA missions and advance the Nation's capabilities by maturing crosscutting and innovative space technologies.",0,,,
"HET2 will create two new space robots (Astrobee and Robonaut 2) that incorporate a wide range of commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) components HET2 will mature, integrate and test open-source software and open standards for robotics and telerobotics HET2 will develop telerobotics technology that can be applied to a wide range of NASA missions, including the ISS, cis-lunar waypoint, Mars orbit, etc.",0,,,
Technical Approach The following sections describe the technical approach that will be used for Astrobee and Robonaut 2.,0,,,
"In keeping with NPR 7120.8, each HET2 Element will research and develop telerobotics technology in accordance with established research practices and NASA's standards to ensure the quality and acceptability in the community of the research results.",0,,,
"In addition, both Elements will perform a variety of ground and on-orbit tests (using the ISS) to characterize, validate, and verify the performance of hardware and software (components, subsystems and integrated system).",0,,,
"Concept of Operations HET2 will develop robot user interfaces, control modes, and human-robot teaming strategies to support the following concepts of operations (“conops”) for telerobotics: Crew control.",0,,,
"The crew performs planning, operations, contingency handling and analysis.",0,,,
Ground control supports crew on an intermittent and/or time-delayed basis.,0,,,
"This conops is appropriate when conditions (orbital geometry, time-delay, etc.)",0,,,
make it impractical for ground control to remotely operate robots in a productive manner.,0,,,
"This conops is also appropriate when a robot is used to extend, or enhance, crew capabilities (sensing, force, etc).",0,,,
Crew/ground shared.,0,,,
Earth-based ground control performs planning and analysis.,0,,,
The crew performs tactical operations.,0,,,
"This conops enables many robot command cycles to be performed, even when the robot is far from Earth.",0,,,
Ground control.,0,,,
"Earth-based ground control performs planning, operations, and analysis.",0,,,
The crew performs interventions when needed.,0,,,
This conops is well suited for handling contingencies that are beyond robot autonomy capabilities.,0,,,
ISS Testing HET2 will make use of the ISS for testing.,0,,,
"Although using the ISS can be complex (particularly in terms of certification and scheduling), the ISS is the only facility available for performing high fidelity, integrated simulations of future deep-space human missions.",0,,,
"In particular, ISS testing is the only way to con- firm that all significant environmental conditions, operational constraints, and other factors are replicated.",0,,,
"Ground-based simulators (laboratory tests, numerical simulations, etc.)",0,,,
"lack fidelity in many areas, including: Effect of micro-gravity on crew (this affects sensorimotor performance, etc.)",0,,,
"Effect of long-duration stay in space on crew (affects cognition, proficiency, etc.)",0,,,
"Crew activities, workload, and other sources of in-flight stress Flight vehicle constraints (including micro- gravity workspace, crew displays, etc.)",0,,,
"The HET2 systems and activities on ISS are classified as ISS payloads (experiments), and as such, must follow the ISS payload process.",0,,,
"This process may require up to 18-month lead-time to allow completion and compliance with: Payload agreements that provide requirements for ISS and supporting facilities Safety certification for launch (for hardware up-mass) and ISS operations Verification of interface requirements to the launch vehicle and to the ISS Development/delivery of engineering documents Development of crew procedures and training Scheduling of crew activity and resources Astrobee Element HET2 is developing Astrobee, a free-flying robot designed to operate inside the International Space Station (ISS).",0,,,
"Astrobee will address multiple scenarios: (1) micro-gravity robotics research facility on ISS, (2) remotely operated mobile sensor platform to perform IVA surveys (e.g., sound levels) and to provide mobile camera views, and (3) autonomous mobile inventory using a RFID scanner.",0,,,
This work will be performed during FY15 to FY18.,0,,,
"At the highest level, the system includes the free-flying robot itself, a dock for replenishing power, and the ground data systems for communication, control and data transfer.",0,,,
Astrobee will be self-contained and autonomous.,0,,,
Ideally it will be capable of fully autonomous localization and navigation inside the United States Operating Segment (USOS) of the International Space Station.,0,,,
"Astrobee will have video cameras on board that will allow it to serve as a remotely operated mobile camera platform, and may be used for localization and navigation.",0,,,
"Astrobee will also have an expansion port(s) where additional sensors and/or hardware can be attached for demonstration, testing and use aboard the station.",0,,,
Additional sensors that may be attached to or integrated with the free-flyer include a RFID reader and the necessary software to communicate with the inventory management system and a HD camera.,0,,,
Astrobee will communicate principally via the station LAN.,0,,,
The propulsion will use electric-motor-driven fans.,0,,,
Localization will include vision-based navigation with and without fiducials and a IMU.,0,,,
Astrobee will also include a perching arm to grab ISS handrails; this will allow Astrobee to hold position without using its propulsion system.,0,,,
Level 1 Requirements Astrobee will address the Level 1 requirements listed in Table 3.,0,,,
Astrobee Level 1 Requirements ID Description FFREQ-75 The Astrobee system shall provide remote control of the Astrobee free-flyer.,0,,,
FFREQ-80 The Astrobee system shall perform autonomous docking for consumable resupply.,0,,,
FFREQ-83 The Astrobee system shall host payloads.,0,,,
FFREQ-89 The Astrobee system shall stream HD video of crew activities.,0,,,
"Astrobee Technology Development Task Objectives This task is focused on incremental design and development of Astrobee that meets project, stakeholder, ISS and Safety requirements.",0,,,
"Stakeholders include the ISS SPHERES Facility, the SPHERES Working Group, HEOMD AES program, ISS program, and others.",0,,,
The project and stakeholders have provided general and use-case specific functional requirements.,0,,,
The primary purpose for Astrobee is to function as a micro-gravity research facility that will eventually succeed the existing SPHERES facility.,0,,,
"In contrast to SPHERES, which was designed to simulate satellites (e.g., in terms of propulsion method), Astrobee is being designed as a robot.",0,,,
"In particular, Astrobee will be based on mobile robot engineering principles (autonomy, perception, navigation, middleware, etc.",0,,,
"), will support telerobotic operations (crew and ground control), and will be capable of autonomous docking and resupply (similar to how robotic vacuum cleaners can autonomously recharge themselves).",0,,,
"Consequently, Astrobee will not be a “drop-in” replacement for SPHERES and will not be able to do everything that the current SPHERES can do.",0,,,
"However, Astrobee will be able to do many more things than the current SPHERES are capable of performing.",0,,,
"As an ISS payload, the ISS Program levies interface requirements on Astrobee for both launch and on-orbit.",0,,,
The ISS Payload Safety Review Panel (PSRP) approves ISS safety certifications.,0,,,
"Complying with certain safety standards mitigates many of the standard ISS safety standards, while others are met by design.",0,,,
"The deliverables for Astrobee system include the Astrobee element, which consists of structure, propulsion, C&DH, communications, thermal, electrical power, GNC, dock mechanism, and perching arm subsystems.",0,,,
"Astrobee system also includes the dock, payloads, and Ground Data Systems (user interfaces for crew control and ground control).",0,,,
Approach Astrobee will be developed incrementally over a series of prototypes.,0,,,
Early prototypes will address trade studies and areas of risk.,0,,,
Later prototypes will implement system requirements and incrementally mature the system design.,0,,,
Prototype 1 was completed before this Project Plan was baselined.,0,,,
"This prototype was developed for risk reduction purposes and included: Structure: Rough structural design for test frame, standoffs, motor mounts, propeller mounts, processor mounts, battery mounts, air bearing interface.",0,,,
"Flight Software (FSW): Low level Processor (LLP) operating system (OS), basic I/O for turning on/off motors, speed control, pitch control, basic software to run open-loop tests with thruster and motion control.",0,,,
Propulsion: Variable pitch propellers (not representative of final system).,0,,,
"EPS: Interim battery selection, wiring/connectors for motors, motor controllers and processor, housekeeping voltage regulators design and fabrication to provide voltage levels needed by processor, motors and motor controllers.",0,,,
Prototype 2 focused on closed loop navigation and interim avionics development.,0,,,
"The subsystem development focused on: Structure: Improved structural design for frame, mounting for motors, propellers, both processors, battery, IMU.",0,,,
"C&DH: Mid and High-level processor selection, data bus selection, and expansion port selection.",0,,,
"Flight Software (FSW): LLP OS; LLP algorithms for velocity limiting; Mid Level Processor (MLP) OS; control algorithms for control of position, orientation, velocity, angular velocity, and trajectory tracking; software for closed loop tests; and data logging.",0,,,
Propulsion: Tested control of 4 variable pitch propellers.,0,,,
"EPS: Battery selection, wiring and connectors for motors, motor controllers and processor, housekeeping voltage regulators design and fabrication to provide voltage levels needed by processor, motors and motor controllers GNC: IMU, camera for fiducial/Vision Based Navigation (VBN) tests.",0,,,
Communication: Functional communication system.,0,,,
Docking: A simple lance/cone to use as a target for navigation.,0,,,
"Prototype 3 focused on remote command and control, implementation of closed loop Vision Based Navigation (VBN), near-flight like avionics, and an approach to docking and perching.",0,,,
Subsystem development will focus on: Structure: Re-use of prototype 2 structure.,0,,,
EPS & C&DH: Near-flight design.,0,,,

Communication: Functional communication system.,0,,,
Flight Software (FSW): LLP near-flight design.,0,,,
Vision-based navigation algorithms.,0,,,
Remote commanding.,0,,,
Test support software.,0,,,
"GNC: Maturation to near flight design, including VBN and perching controller.",0,,,
Perching Arm: Near-flight design with a perching arm assembly.,0,,,
"Control stations: The Operator UI, ISS models, commanding and monitoring.",0,,,
This will also include minimal RAPID/DDS protocols.,0,,,
Prototype 4 will focus on the flight-like hardware design.,0,,,
"Structure: Flight like design, 3D printed, no “paint job”.",0,,,
Propulsion: Flight propulsion modules.,0,,,
C&DH: Flight avionics stack.,0,,,
GN&C: Flight IMU and software.,0,,,
Flight Software (FSW): Minimal software to enable testing of all hardware-related requirements.,0,,,
Thermal: Active Thermal control.,0,,,
Docking: Full dock to include the ISS interface.,0,,,
Non-flight like Dock.,0,,,
Control stations: Planning module / plan editor for the Operator Control Station.,0,,,
"The Certification Units will be developed off the final Prototype 4 design, with any modifications derived from the results of Prototype 4 testing.",0,,,
"These units will not only be used for performance testing, but also for environmental testing and ISS interface requirement verification and certification.",0,,,
Flight Software (FSW): Sufficient software to test hardware and all ISS and Safety requirements.,0,,,
"Control stations: Crew Control Station, updated planning and commanding UI.",0,,,
"Finally, two Flight Units will be developed.",0,,,
"These units will be developed, assembled, and curated in appropriate facilities following ARC procedures and processes for flight hardware.",0,,,
Challenges/Risks There are several technical challenges to the development of Astrobee.,0,,,
"First is the accuracy of a navigation system for localizing, positioning, orientation and pointing.",0,,,
Astrobee requires a robust navigation system that can localize throughout the entire U.S. orbital segment on ISS.,0,,,
"Rather than build up the ISS infrastructure to include multiple positioning beacons, Astrobee team is looking for a vision-based navigation (VBN) solution.",0,,,
"However, there are not any VBN solutions readily available for mobile devices.",1,Technical,,
"The HET project has tested a prototype commercial product that offers VBN, however preliminary testing of that device indicates that it will not work well in 0g.",0,,,
"Therefore, it may be necessary for HET2 to develop its own mobile VBN system.",0,,,
This still may not meet Astrobee accuracy requirements.,0,,,
"As a fall back plan, the team may propose to use Augmented Reality (AR) targets in one area of the ISS for high accuracy navigation operations.",0,,,
"The ISS has limitations on the amount of noise caused by a payload, both continuously and intermittently.",1,Technical,,
Astrobee team will need to find high performance fans that fall within the noise limits.,0,,,
One of the most significant challenges in the development of Astrobee is developing a system that meets human spaceflight safety standards for an anonymous free-flying robot.,1,Technical,,
The Payload Safety Review Panel (PSRP) at JSC approves all ISS payloads.,0,,,
The PSRP has a standard set of hazards that each payload must assess and prove that the hazard is not applicable or mitigated.,0,,,
The team must also determine if there are other unique hazards for their payload.,0,,,
"For a free-flying robot, the possibility of collisions is most definitely a unique hazard.",1,Technical,,
Mitigating this hazard for an autonomous free-flyer (meaning crew cannot be used for hazard mitigation) will be a significant challenge.,1,Technical,,

"To meet these objectives, this task involves ISS activities to test and demonstrate Astrobee and ground activities to support the ISS work.",0,,,
"The ISS activities involve installation and activation, map data collection, basic checkout, performance characterization, and an operations demonstration.",0,,,
The ground activities involve map development and software tuning.,0,,,
"Approach This task will perform all ISS activities following the ISS payload process, including working with an ISS Payload Integration Manager (PIM) and the ISS Payload Safety Review Panel (PSRP) to obtain all necessary approvals and concurrence on documentation required for ISS activities.",0,,,
"In addition, the Astrobee Element will coordinate and jointly perform on-orbit tests and demonstrations with the SPHERES Program, including the SPHERES chief engineer and SPHERES operations team.",0,,,
"The Astrobee Element will develop crew operational procedures and ground operational, troubleshooting and maintenance procedures.",0,,,
"The team will create training material for crew and ground personnel, and conduct training for the Astrobee and SPHERES operations teams.",0,,,
"Further, the operations teams will conduct operational readiness tests (ORTs) in advance of each ISS activity.",0,,,
"Regression testing will be performed to verify correct performance after software configuration changes, enhancements, or patches.",0,,,
The first several on-orbit tasks will require ISS crew participation.,0,,,
"Crew will be required to install the Docking Station, plug batteries into the Astrobees, turn them on, and place them into the Docking Station for charging.",0,,,
"Next, they will need to be present while component checks are performed (nozzles opened, signal lights turned on, touch screen displays data, etc.)",0,,,
to verify those components work.,0,,,
Crew will then hold a single Astrobee and use its cameras to map a limited area of the ISS.,0,,,
"With a local map in place, crew will oversee some basic mobility tests, including autonomous docking (L1 requirement FFREQ-80).",0,,,
"Once that capability is proven, crew will no longer be required to tend to Astrobee commissioning activities.",0,,,
"Under control from the ground (L1 requirement FFREQ-75), Astrobee will perform increasingly complex mobility maneuvers that will help tune flight software, GNC software, and ground simulators.",0,,,
These tests will also be used to help characterize the system.,0,,,
Astrobee will also be used to incrementally expand its map of the ISS.,0,,,
"The free flyer will be commanded to the edge of its known map to ""peek out"" at unknown territory.",0,,,
The number of increments required to complete a map is the ISS USOS is not known.,0,,,
"However, since no crew time is required to perform incremental mapping, this is not expected to be an issue.",0,,,
"Finally, Astrobee will be demonstrated to its prospective customers.",0,,,
"Astrobee will demonstrate research facility operations (L1 requirement FFREQ-83) for the SPHERES Program, including operations running Guest Science software, as well as with and without a hardware payload.",0,,,
The Astrobee Element is dependent on the Advanced Exploration Systems Logistics Reduction (AES/LR) project having the REALM (RFID reader) payload ready for this demonstration.,0,,,
Astrobee will demonstrate mobile camera operations (L1 requirement FFREQ-89) for the ISS Program and Flight Operations Directorate.,0,,,
"Challenges/Risks The first several ISS activities require crew time, which is not guaranteed and is dependent upon ISS operational constraints involving crew.",1,Programmatic,,
"Priority may be given to other experiments (biological experiments with expiration dates, physiological experiments that require specific crew) or other activities (e.g., unplanned EVAs) may reduce the amount of time available for payloads.",0,,,
"Consequently, the project is planning for significant schedule margin to mitigate this risk.",0,,,
The Astrobee payload demonstration also depends on availability of the AES/LR REALM payload.,1,Programmatic,,
"If this payload is not available, then Astrobee/SPHERES will need to develop its own test payload for the demonstration.",1,Programmatic,,
All ISS payloads must submit a request for the number of crew hours they will require to support their on orbit activies.,0,,,
"Astrobee commissioning activities will be attempted with as little crew time as possible and will follow the appropriate Element control plans (concept of operations, payload integration agreement, etc) as listed in Appendix D:.",0,,,
"There are certain activities that will require crew (Dock installation, system activation, ISS mapping).",0,,,
"However, whenever possible, activities will be remotely controlled from the ground.",0,,,
"If any of these remotely controlled activities fail (e.g., Astrobee fails to find its way back to the Dock), the project may have to ask crew to intervene.",1,Programmatic,,
"The activities will be structured to minimize the risk that crew will be needed, but this approach precludes crew from having to oversee the entirety of Astrobee activities.",0,,,

R2 work will focus on demonstrating legged IVA mobility using the climbing legs that were installed during the HET project in August 2014.,0,,,
This work will be performed during FY15 to FY16-Q1.,0,,,
R2 Climbing Task Objectives This task is focused on continuing the checkout and advancement of R2 currently on the ISS.,0,,,
"R2’s legs were recently installed to its torso but R2 has yet to take its first steps so the objective of this task is to demonstrate R2’s ability to climb from hand rail to hand rail gaining experience with climbing gaits, forces and ops concepts.",0,,,
"Approach A series of incrementally challenging maneuvers will be scheduled for R2 beginning with the ungrasping of its currently held handrail, maneuvering away from the handrail and then using its vision system to identify and re-grasp that same handrail.",0,,,
"Eventually, R2 will demonstrate its ability to grasp handrails from an angled approach, avoid obstacles covering handrails, climb from one handrail to the next and maneuver within the ISS Lab module.",0,,,
R2 will also demonstrate its ability to stow and un-stow itself without crew assistance.,0,,,
This task also includes any maintenance required to keep R2 operational on ISS.,0,,,
Crew procedures for on-orbit tests will be developed and practiced on the R2 cert unit (on the ground).,0,,,
Coordination will be performed with the Payload Operations Integration Center at MSFC to obtain procedure approval and to obtain crew time for on-orbit sessions.,0,,,
Challenges/Risks Climbing has been demonstrated on the ground in a laboratory test environment so confidence is high this capability can be demonstrated on-orbit.,0,,,
"There is always risk that hardware may have been damaged during the launch process, but checkout testing to date on the ISS has shown no indication of damage.",1,Technical,,
"Maneuvering within the Space Station modules, given the clutter of cables and equipment, will be a challenge R2 will have to overcome.",1,Technical,,
The risk is R2 may be limited in its ability to navigate through the modules without crew assistance in clearing a translation path.,1,Technical,,

"Thus, the objective of this task is demonstrate that R2 can successfully perform a complex IVA task that the ISS Program would like to perform robotically.",0,,,
Approach Work with the ISS Program to identify an IVA task that R2 can perform without crew assistance.,0,,,
"Ideally, the task will be one that is also relevant to EVA work.",0,,,
Perform a ground demonstration using the R2 Certification unit to define the required procedures before progressing to the on-orbit demonstration.,0,,,
Challenges/Risks Transitioning from a technology demonstration to an operational system is a significant challenge.,1,Technical,,
Successfully performing a task without crew intervention and also reducing crew workload is critical to proving the utility of R2.,1,Technical,,

Approach Recent R2 hardware upgrades (increased computing capacity) and software upgrades (transition to open source Robot Operating System (ROS)) have paved the way for greatly enhancing the control of R2.,0,,,
"Taking advantage of new capabilities in ROS, including the infusion of algorithms developed by other ROS users, and on-board data processing will allow for more robust path planning and machine vision for R2 and “point and click” supervisory interfaces for ground controllers.",0,,,
An incremental approach will be used to increase the level of autonomy on R2.,0,,,
"Software developed in the lab will transition to the R2 simulation for evaluation, then proceed to certification testing prior to uplink to ISS.",0,,,
The goal is to reach a level of autonomy where ground support is only assisting the robot 5% of the time.,0,,,
"During FY16-Q1, activities to position the ISS R2 unit as an exploration IVA dexterous mobile testbed on ISS will be performed.",0,,,
Mobility software demonstrated as part of the FY15 IVA ground demonstration will be modified to increase robustness and additional supervisory features will be added to improve handrail-to-handrail climbing.,0,,,
The affordance template technique used for manipulation will be implemented with handrail templates allowing the human operator to supervise the selection of handrails.,0,,,
Extensive ground testing will be performed to ensure readiness for use on-orbit.,0,,,
Challenges/Risks Developing robust path planning and obstacle avoidance software algorithms is a major challenge.,1,Technical,,
Creating software to parameterize possible grasps will also be key to developing a supervisory control interface that is easily adaptable to real time situations.,1,Technical,,
"The risk is that R2’s safety control and monitoring system limits its capabilities, reducing its effectiveness and ability to quickly respond to on-orbit requests for support.",1,Technical,,

"These KPPs are important for Robonaut to achieve because they demonstrate Robonaut’s independent mobility capability, including self-stowing and un-stowing.",0,,,
Mobility is important because it allows Robonaut to maneuver inside the spacecraft and get into position to perform various tasks and also extends to an EVA Robonaut where crew intervention will not be readily available.,0,,,
The KPPs also address the ISS Program’s desire to reduce the impact Robonaut operations have on crew time in the near term and to help eventually reduce crew time in the long term by performing a task that would otherwise be performed by the crew.,0,,,
