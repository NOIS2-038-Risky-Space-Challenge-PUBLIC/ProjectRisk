"To enable greater mission self-sufficiency for long-duration missions to the moon and beyond, a new paradigm is required – one that enables mission planners to adopt a “make it there, don’t take it there” approach by using advanced in situ resource utilization (ISRU) and In-Space Manufacturing (ISM) techniques for on-demand production.",0,,,
The Space Technology Mission Directorate (STMD) Game Changing Development (GCD) Synthetic Biology (SynBio) project is designed to demonstrate the value of emerging synthetic biology approaches to meet mission demands.,0,,,
"It is the intent to leverage these new techniques to design, build and test biomanufacturing systems capable of operating in demanding space environments, be able to withstand long periods of storage before use, and perform safely and reliably.",0,,,
"In addition, the SynBio project is also focusing on methods to reduce the logistical requirements for biomanufacturing in space.",0,,,
"In particular, the project is focusing on using in situ resources (i.e., CO2) that can be converted to the organic substrates required for heterotrophic microbial growth.",0,,,
"This is an important capability that will allow biomanufacturing systems to scale to viable production systems for mission products such as food components, pharmaceuticals, polymers, fuels, and a range of valuable chemicals.",0,,,
Such capabilities will also spur progress for purely chemical (non-biological) synthesis methods for in situ product generation.,0,,,
2.0 Project Objectives The Synthetic Biology project includes two primary focus area: BioNutrients and CO2-Based Manufacturing.,0,,,
The Primary objectives of each are as follows: 1) BioNutrients: Develop and test a platform technology for the on-demand microbial manufacturing of multiple human nutrients to mitigate nutrient deficiencies in the current food system for long duration missions.,0,,,
"2) BioNutrients: Develop and flight test a production pack system that enables required nutrient production after long-duration storage of the microorganisms and media, requires minimal mass and volume, and complies with required food safety requirements.",0,,,
3) BioNutrients: Develop and flight test procedures specified in the Hazard Analysis and Critical Control Point (HACCP) plan and in-space monitoring methods for assessing food safety for implementation during future missions.,0,,,
"4) CO2-Based Manufacturing: Perform an initial integration of the developed CO2 conversion, bioreactor, engineered organism and purification systems to both demonstrate the validity of the concept, and to identify needs/challenges for prototype development.",0,,,
"5) CO2-Based Manufacturing: Develop “space-ready” engineered microorganism(s) capable of making a targeted mission product (carbonic anhydrase), and test with an improved production and product harvesting system that is compatible with spacecraft environments during lunar and Mars missions.",0,,,
"6) CO2-Based Manufacturing: Develop use case scenarios for this overall approach, identify needed future areas of research and development, and provide recommendations for forward work.",0,,,

Key Performance Parameters Key Performance Parameters (BioNutrients) Performance Parameter Units State of the Art Threshold Value Project Goal KPP 1: ISS production pack viability lifespan (1) years N/A(2) 3 5 KPP 2 : Microbial safety assessment(3) cfu/100ml <100 <50 <1 KPP 3: Biomanufacturing platform supplies multiple nutrients(4) number of nutrients 1 2 4 Notes: (1) A production pack is considered to be “viable” if it demonstrates the ability to make targeted nutrients at >50% when compared to initial ISS production packs.,0,,,
This KPP assesses effects of storage over time.,0,,,
"Viable production packs that have been stored and tested on ISS for 3 years (Threshold Value) are assumed to be suitable for extended Lunar surface mission needs, and a 5 year lifespan (Project Goal) is needed for Mars surface missions as per the Human Research Program 5-year stored food shelf-life requirements.",0,,,
(2) There is no SOA for this KPP because there are currently no means of making nutrients during spaceflight.,0,,,
(3) Microbial safety is assessed using NASA food safety Petri-film testing procedures (NASA-STD-3001 Vol.,0,,,
"A) for the coliform, Staphylococcus and Salmonella tests expressed as Colony Formation Units (CFU)/100ml.",0,,,
Includes microscopic inspection for dead cells.,0,,,
"(4) Intent is to build a biomanufacturing platform that provides on-demand, simultaneous availability of multiple nutrients with minimal mass, power, and volume requirements.",0,,,
"Key Performance Parameters (CO2-Based Biomanufacturing) Performance Parameter Units State of the Art Threshold Value Project Goal KPP 4: Biomass harvest efficiency (1) percentage - (2) 85 97 KPP 5: % of solid media components sourced from CO2, H2, and recycled mission wastes(3) percentage 0 (4) 50 80 Notes: (1) This represents the amount of biomass that is able to be processed in relation to the total amount produced within the system (total amount produced will be assessed as amount from nominal operation plus amount recovered following enhanced manual recovery and inspection of system).",0,,,
Biomass loss due to biofilm formation or inaccessible due to geometry and flow design of the reactor can significantly reduce performance of the overall system.,0,,,
"Maximizing biomass recovery greatly improves overall system efficiency, and drives organism selection and efficient reactor design/operation.",0,,,
"Our current product is carbonic anhydrase, a non-secreted product for which biomass is an acceptable proxy.",0,,,
Note: Biomass containing carbonic anhydrase can potentially be utilized in a liquid amine system without further purification.,0,,,
(2) There are no space-based biomanufacturing systems to serve as a SOA.,0,,,
Harvest efficiencies in commercial terrestrial systems can vary based on specific organisms and procedures used.,0,,,
Commercial bioreactor harvesting efficiencies are often quoted as ~97% and we will use this as a comparative value.,0,,,
"(3) This represents the percent of the overall media components that are sourced from CO2 and hydrogen (both of which could be obtained through ISRU), microbial biomass recycling, and potentially crew wastes that result in a viable media for use in the developed bioreactor system growing the organism engineered to make the target product (nominally carbonic anhydrase).",0,,,
"To be considered a viable growth media, it must meet the minimal criteria of providing at least 5% carbon substrate utilization efficiency (i.e., 5 gm biomass is derived from 100 gm carbon substrate).",0,,,
(4) The BioNutrients production pack approach is selected as the space-based SOA technology.,0,,,
"In this approach, all media components are launched.",0,,,
Therefore the % media components sourced from ISRU equals 0%.,0,,,
